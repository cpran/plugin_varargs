varargs
=======

Description
-----------

This plugin provides an interface to make it easier to write
variadic procedures (ie, procedures that take a variable 
number of arguments), or procedures that specify true default
values for some of their parameters.

It is also possible to write procedures that take any number
of arguments, like the `min()` standard function.

Requirements
------------

* None
